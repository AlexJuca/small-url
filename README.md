Small URL is a web application for generating short links built with [Phoenix LiveView](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_live_view). It currently 
supports the following features:

  * Generates Short Links of long URL's

  * View stats for Short Links in realtime

  * Share Short Link on Twitter and Facebook

  * Many more features coming!

## Why another short link generator?

Simple really, I wanted to work on a small but useful project that I could opensource and that would help me understand the basics of the following:

1. Phoenix Livew

2. Phoenix.PubSub

3. Phoenix.LiveComponent

4. Phoenix Client-Side Hooks using Javascript
